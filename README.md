# Warning

This script is designed to run if you are me, soolar. Otherwise it will definitely
not work, because it depends on some other local scripts I have not uploaded.

None of them are anything major though, I believe it's mostly just my logout
script, which maximizes me for rollover and that's about it.

While it will not run for you as is, it shouldn't be too much work to adapt it for
your own nefarious purposes. So you are free to do that as you see fit.

In case it's not clear, this script runs my daily loops for farming when I am doing so.

Oh also it depends on several other scripts which I have not set up a dependency on,
such as loop-casual and PHCCS. If you can't run both of those scripts reliably, you
aren't going to get far with this one even with just a little bit of editing, so good luck.
